# SCADA Application Guide

## Overview and Uses

The SCADA application forms part of the digital twin ecosystem. It can be used to further expand the data visualization of the digital twin. It does so by adding value indicators, graphs with single or multiple plots on them, easy image importing, and basic widgets that make the SCADA look and feel professional.

## How to Edit the SCADA 

Most of the SCADA editing can be done in the app window itself, meaning very little code has to be written in order to make changes to the system.

This is done by utilizing the edit mode provided by the application. A short rundown of all the commands used for editing the page, with their hotkey/shortcut, is listed below. Further detail will be provided later in the document.

- **Enter Edit Mode (*e*)**
- **Exit Edit Mode (*e*)**
- **Save Current Page (*s*)**
- **Add Element to Page (*a*)**
- **Select Element to Edit (*left click*)**
- **Unselect Selected Element (*left click*)**

Once an element is created and selected, the following commands can be used to edit the element. Note that although more than one element can be selected at a time, some of these commands will only work if a single element is selected.

- **Increase Width (**)**
- **Decrease Width (**)**
- **Increase Height (**)**
- **Decrease Height (**)**
- **Rotate Clockwise (**)**
- **Rotate Anticlockwise (**)**
- **Quick move element (**)**

The quick move function works when an element(s) is selected; the selection highlight will change color to indicate the mode. Then wherever the user clicks, the element(s) will jump to.

Some other useful shortcuts are as follows:

- **View selected element's info (**)**
- **Change selected element's info (**)**
- **Edit the movement and edit sensitivity (**)**
- **Copy and paste selected element (**)**
- **Delete selected element (**)**
- **Add new page button (**)**

After editing a page, it is important to save the page (Does not require editing mode to be active), before closing the application or changing to a new page. If you do not do this all changes made will be lost.
